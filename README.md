# Familiar-Face
Build a model to perform image classifications to assist in reuniting families with the missing people database.


### Project Description
There are multiple missing children in this world and I would love to help reconnect families with their loved ones. Human trafficking is a serious issue our country deals with and if we can optimize the search criteria, I believe the world can gain from this project.
